Its primary goal is to assist developers in gaining insights from unstructured data, potentially facilitating data cleansing and optimizing LLMs through fine-tuning processes. Bunkatopics is constructed using well-known libraries like langchain, chroma, and transformers, enabling seamless integration into various environments.</p> <p>Discover the different Use Case:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Content Overview: The Medium website offers a wealth of content across various categories such as Data Science, Technology, Programming, Poetry, Cryptocurrency, Machine Learning, Life, and more. While these categories facilitate data searching, they may not provide a granular overview. For instance, within the Technology category, what specific topics does Medium cover?</p> </li> <li> <p>Fine-Tuning: To achieve precise fine-tuning, it's crucial to exercise control over the data, filtering what is relevant and discarding what isn't.
